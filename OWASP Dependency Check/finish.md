We were able to use the OWASP Dependency Check to identify dependencies in our application that contain known vulnerabilities. It is very difficult to maintain even a small application with no known vulnerabilities. To punctuate this, `CVE-2020-10683` is a new vulnerability that was added while I was creating this lab. This is why it is so important to have a documentation plan on how to deal with dependencies that you are currently unable to update.
