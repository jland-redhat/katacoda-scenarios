# Wrap Up

We explored the different types of http security avalible in OpenAPI. And set up our spring-boot application with security by connecting to a Keycloak server using the OpenID Connect protocal. And were able to validate our application as well as explore the Identity Layer that OpenID Connect adds on to the normal oAuth 2 flow.
